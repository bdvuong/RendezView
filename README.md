## Project Description
RendezView is an improved version of the popular scheduling app When2Meet.
Our application implements an account-based project scheduling system. A user
creates and account and once they are logged in, they will be presented a dashboard
of all project groups that they are a member of. Inside each project group, the 
user, and all other participants can specify the times in which they are available.
The application then finds overlapping availabilities and suggests possible meeting times
when all members are available. 

## Instructions
Upon opening RendezView, you will be greeted with a page where you can either
log into the application or create an account. Creating an account is straightforward,
click sign up button and specify a username and password. Now you can log in with the 
newly created credentials. An existing account with the following credentials can also be
logged into.
<br />
`username: admin`<br />
`password: admin`<br />
You can create a new group by pressing the _Create New Group_ button. Here you
can specify the group name, description, and users. Note that you cannot add users
who do not exist to a group. For demonstration purposes you can add yourself, a user
named `brandon` and a user named `randy`. Now that the group has been created you can 
either delete it or go to the group page to specify your availability.
